### module 5 challenge for bootcamp

This app is built using:
*   HTML/CSS

*   Javascript

*   Jquery

*   Bootstrap

*   Moment.js

I used javascript and jquery to write most of the html. I use bootstrap columns to create the structure. I used Moment.js to format that date and time.

Live app deployment can be found here:

I was given starter code that can be found here:
